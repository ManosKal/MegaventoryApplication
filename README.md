# MegaventoryApplication
For this application I firstly tried to familiarize myself with the Megaventory API.
After that I made a simple code to try and test if I could communicate with the server.
When this was done I started insertinging the required entities to my account and completed the second and third task.
While seeing that all was running successful I created another code where it was interactive and anyone could insert any information of the rquiered fields to their account.
Then I added some final details so the user could insert information to as many fields as many times as the user wanted and then exit when the user was done.
